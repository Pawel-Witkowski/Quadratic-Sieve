# Quadratic-Sieve

Quadratic Sieve without the squares differential.
Sieve with square differential is the way to factorise big numbers with
much better efficiency than Erastotenes Sieve. Unfornutalety it's only
legit for numbers lower than 150 bits.

It's one of the academic tasks within the subject named "Introduction
into Public Key Cryptosystem". Got the B grade (4).
